# Example updater.properties.
# The actual gradle will first try its own directory to see if `updater.properties` exists, then try a level up.
# As such, you should make sure this is either directly in the project you intend to update, or just a level deep as a submodule.

# Keys starting with `$` marks metadata. Metadata and repository references are not allowed.
# Keys starting with `@` marks repositories. Metadata references are allowed. Repositories are allowed, however, the reference should only be one deep. No recursion expected to take place.
# Values starting with `$` is a metadata reference. There is metadata that are generated when any prerequisite data is present.
# Values starting with `@` is a repository reference. Any repository reference not made within a repository will attempt to resolve the dependency.
